# Mars Imager <br />
This is a project that grabs images from a mars api and displays them to the user. <br />
The entire site uses Bootstrap so that it is responsive and works on mobile. <br />
The backend is written in PHP and main components are written with MVC architecture. <br />
There are two versions v1 and v2. v2 contains improvements upon features such as responsiveness and 
refresh functionalities provided by JS.  <br />
### Why was this created? <br />
I created Mars Imager as NASA website which displayed rover images was created in the mid-2000s and was incredibly difficult to view multiple images at once. Their website was also clunky and required the use of 4 drop downs to get a single image. This website serves to streamline the process so the rover images can be viewed quickly. This is also my first project where I have put a heavy emphasis on structure so that the code is easy to read and reuse.
# STRUCTURE: <br />
- Root: Contains all main html pages <br />
- Root/php: Contains all php code. Main MVC Code is indicated by xxx-rover-ver.php <br />
- Root/components: Contains JS and CSS <br />
- Root/components/images: Images used for the site are stored here <br />
